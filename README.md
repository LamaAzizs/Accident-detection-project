# CCTV Accident Detection with YOLO and Streamlit

This project is a CCTV accident detection application using the YOLO model, Streamlit, and Google Generative AI. The app analyzes video footage to detect accidents, generates detailed reports, and provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and managing accident reports.

## Features


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07f46975-8bd2-42ef-81f9-763c386faa95


- **Real-time Accident Detection:** Uses the YOLO model to detect accidents in video footage.
- **Video Annotation:** Annotates the video with detected objects and displays it in a Streamlit app.
- **Automated Report Generation:** Generates and saves accident reports with details like class, confidence score, and timestamp.
- **Accident Description:** Uses Google Generative AI to generate a professional accident description based on the detected incident.
- **Report Management:** Displays saved reports and associated images, with an option to generate or view detailed descriptions.

## Project Structure


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `best_model_without_freeze.pt` (YOLO model weights)
- Google API key for Generative AI (stored in a `.env` file)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/cctv-accident-detection.git
    cd cctv-accident-detection
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the `.env` file:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

4. **Download the YOLO model weights:**
   Place the `best_model_without_freeze.pt` file in the project root.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

2. **Navigate to the app:**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. **Video & Prediction Page:**
   - Upload a video file to analyze.
   - The app will display the annotated video and detect accidents.
   - If an accident is detected, a report is generated and saved.

2. **Reports Page:**
   - View saved accident reports with details like class, confidence, and timestamp.
   - See associated images for each report.
   - Generate or view accident descriptions using Google Generative AI.

## Example

- **Detected Accident Report:**
    ```
    Class: Accident
    Confidence: 0.85
    Time: 2024-10-13_14-30-00
    Description: Two vehicles involved, with visible damage on the front of one vehicle. Road conditions are wet, and traffic is partially blocked.
    ```

## Dependencies

- `opencv-python`
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `ultralytics`
- `numpy`
- `google-generativeai`
- `python-dotenv`

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for different video formats.
- Implement email notifications for generated accident reports.
- Integrate with a cloud storage service for report storage.
